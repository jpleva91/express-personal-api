## SUPER STRETCH: Part 2. Personal Dashboard

#### Consume the Personal API you just created, and use it to build your own personal dashboard.

* Create an `index.html` **homepage** that's linked to your main javascript and css files.
* Use **jQuery** and **AJAX** to consume your Personal API.
* Use **Handlebars** Templating to render data to the page.
* Display **at least one image/gif** that you retrieved from your Personal API.
* Create **at least one form**, so you can CRUD at least one of your resources.
* Get rid of that ugly blue background. Style it up! **Make your momma proud**.
